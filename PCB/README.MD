The printed circuit board has been created with Autosoft Eagle: http://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/eagle.
Use this software to open the .sch (Schematic) or .brd (Board) files.

You can also use the Gerber.zip and upload it to any PCB service of your choice to manufacture the board, or get it from me against a small donation.

OSH Park also sells the PCB: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ddHY98QR
