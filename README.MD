The **DIY-Thermocam** is a **do-it-yourself** infrared camera, based on the popular **FLIR Lepton** long-wave-infrared array sensor.  The **material price** of all components is at about **300€**, which makes the device the **cheapest standalone solution** for thermal imaging.

The aim of this project is to give **private persons**, **educational institutes** and **companies** access to a **portable**,  **affordable** and **customizable** thermal imaging plattform.
 
There are **various applications** like finding **heat leaks** in the insulation of buildings, the analysis of **electrical** or **mechanical components**, the **detection** of **persons** / animals or even mounting it on a **drone**, together with the additional **video out module**.
 
Constructed as a **self-assembly solution**, the DIY-Thermocam allows you to take **advantage** of the **versatile possibilities** of thermal imaging and to **save money** at one go.
 
**Everything**, from **software** to **hardware**, is completely **open-source**! This allows everyone to **modify** or **extend** the functionalities of the device to their **own needs**!

**Donate** to **support this project**. In return, will receive the **newest revision** of the **printed circuit board** by post. All **other components** can be bought from **distributors** on the **bill of material list** (BOM) inside the document folder. The **enclosure** can be created with a **3D printer** or a **laser cutter**.
