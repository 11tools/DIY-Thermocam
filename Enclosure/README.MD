The design is created with Google Sketchup.

You can order the 2D laser cut side plates from Ponoko: http://www.ponoko.com/design-your-own/products/diy-thermocam-v2-enclosure-13930

Or get it from me against a small donation.

You could also use a 3D printer to make your custom version of the enclosure, together with the 3D design files.
