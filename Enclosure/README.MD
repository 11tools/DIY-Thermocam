There are **4 versions** of the enclosure. The **Arudam V1** camera is used in **all devices build from 2018**, as the **Arducam V2** part has become **deprecated**. You can distinguish between those two by having a look at the lense. The V1 has a big lense on top of it, the V2 only a very flat one.

The difference between the **radiometric** and **non-radiometric** versions is, that the non-radiometric setup also needs an external spot sensor. For the radiometric version, this cutout in the enclosure has been removed.

You can find those four versions in the corresponding folders:

**ArducamV1_NonRadiometric**: Made for the Arducam V1 Mini 2MP camera and the Lepton2.0 / Lepton3.0 non-radiometric sensor

**ArducamV1_Radiometric**: Made for the Arducam V1 Mini 2MP camera and the Lepton2.5 radiometric sensor

**ArducamV2_NonRadiometric**: Made for the Arducam V2 Mini 2MP camera and the Lepton2.0 / Lepton3.0 non-radiometric sensor

**ArducamV2_Radiometric**: Made for the Arducam V2 Mini 2MP camera and the Lepton2.5 radiometric sensor

The enclosure has been designed with Google Sketchup for a material thickness of **3mm**. The standard enclosure is cut out of **black acryl plastic** by a laser cutting service. 

Popular services are **ponoko.com** located in the USA and GB, **formulor.de** from Germany and **seedstudio.com** from China. The price for one case should be around 10â‚¬. You can also use a 3D printer to print out the case on your own, but in that case you have to adapt the 3D files for **3D printing**, as they were designed for laser cutting.
