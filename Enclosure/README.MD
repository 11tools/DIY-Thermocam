There are **two versions** of the enclosure. The difference between the **radiometric** and **non-radiometric** versions is, that the non-radiometric setup also needs an external spot sensor. For the radiometric version, this cutout in the enclosure has been removed.

For most users starting the project now, the **radiometric** version will be the preferred one, in case they use the **Lepton2.5** or **Lepton3.5** as sensor. For this version, there exists also a folder "3D print", which, contains the **single sides for 3D printing** instead of laser cutting.

The non-radiometric version is suitable for the **Lepton2.0** as well as the **Lepton3.0**. It has an additional hole for the MLX90614 spot sensor.

**Patrik Thürlemann** from the Kantonsschule Trogen has created a nice 3D enclosure for the radiometric version of the device:

You can find it in the folder "**3D_Print_Radiometric**". It includes STEP and STL files.

The enclosure has been designed with Google Sketchup for a material thickness of **3mm**. The standard enclosure is cut out of **black acryl plastic** by a laser cutting service. 


Popular services are **ponoko.com** located in the USA and GB, **formulor.de** from Germany and **seedstudio.com** from China. The price for one case should be around 10€. You can also use a 3D printer to print out the case on your own, but in that case you have to adapt the 3D files for **3D printing**, as they were designed for laser cutting.
