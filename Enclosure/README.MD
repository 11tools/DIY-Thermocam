There are **two versions** of the enclosure. The difference between the **radiometric** and **non-radiometric** versions is, that the non-radiometric setup also needs an external spot sensor. For the radiometric version, this cutout in the enclosure has been removed.

For most users starting the project now, the **ArducamV1_Radiometric** version will be the preferred one, in case they use the **Lepton3.5** as sensor. For this version, there exists also a folder "3D print", which, contains the **single sides for 3D printing** instead of laser cutting.

----------

The enclosure has been designed with Google Sketchup for a material thickness of **3mm**. The standard enclosure is cut out of **black acryl plastic** by a laser cutting service. 


Popular services are **ponoko.com** located in the USA and GB, **formulor.de** from Germany and **seedstudio.com** from China. The price for one case should be around 10â‚¬. You can also use a 3D printer to print out the case on your own, but in that case you have to adapt the 3D files for **3D printing**, as they were designed for laser cutting.


You can download the free version of **Google Sketchup** here: [https://goo.gl/GSqC8C](https://goo.gl/GSqC8C)
**Inkscape** for editing the 2D SVG files can be loaded here: [https://goo.gl/w8YHZN](https://goo.gl/w8YHZN)
